/**
 * iOS native preview playback client (#54).
 *
 * The iOS counterpart to `previewPlayer.ts`: instead of an HTML5 `<audio>` element, it drives a native
 * `AVPlayer` engine (Rust/objc2) via the `native_preview_*` Tauri commands. The engine owns the lock
 * screen (`MPRemoteCommandCenter` / `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`), so prev/next/scrubber keep working
 * while the WebView's JavaScript is suspended on lock — which the HTML5 path can't do.
 *
 * Orchestrated by `playerStore`, which branches to this module on iOS (see `isIOS()`), pre-resolves
 * every track's proxy URL, and subscribes to the engine's events via `startNativePreviewBridge`.
