/**
 * Two-tier playback queue — the single "what plays next / previous / what's up next" for BOTH
 * platforms and BOTH sources (discovery previews and library tracks), so `player.ts` can stay focused
 * on the audio engines. Platform-agnostic (no desktop/mobile imports); `player.ts` drives playback by
 * asking it for the next/previous pick and feeding the iOS native window from `peekUpcoming`; desktop
 * captures its library/discovery contexts into it via `startLibrarySession`/`startPreviewSession`.
 *
 * Two tiers, Spotify/Apple-Music style:
 *  - **Context queue** — the list playback started from (the discovery feed, the visible library
 *    view), held as a FLAT list of picks with a per-pick group key ("release" for previews, album for
 *    library tracks). Shuffle reorders THIS. Captured per session via `start*Session`.
 *  - **User queue** — explicit items added with `addToQueue` (append) / `playNext` (front-insert).
 *    FIFO, never reshuffled, always plays before the context resumes. Preview entries are persisted
 *    across relaunch.
 *
 * "Up Next" = the forward replay tail (if the user stepped back) ++ the user queue ++ the upcoming
 * context. A unified play `history` powers "previous" across BOTH tiers and both shuffle/sequential
 * modes; the no-repeat shuffle bag (`shufflePlayed`) only governs how NEW context picks are drawn.
 * The repeat mode (see `RepeatMode`) scopes how the context continues once a pass ends — the committed
 * lookahead applies it in ONE place (`extendLookahead`) so playback, Up Next, the native window, and
 * `canAdvance` always agree.
 */

/**
 * Repeat cycle: off → track → release → context.
 *  - `off` — advance stops at the end of the context (no wrap, no reshuffle).
 *  - `track` — the current track loops, literally: natural end restarts it at the player level, and
 *    the queue's own advance (Next button, lock screen, auto-advance fallbacks) replays it too, with
 *    Up Next forecasting it. NOT Spotify's repeat-one (skip-proceeds) — users read "next plays a
 *    different track" as repeat not working. The explicit user queue still wins a manual skip, so
 *    queued items stay reachable (and the loop then re-anchors on them).
 *  - `release` — advance loops within the CURRENT group only (the release for previews, the album for
 *    library tracks; re-anchors to the playing context-tier pick — a user-queued interlude plays once
 *    and hands back to the release it interrupted, see `contextSeed`).
 *  - `context` — advance wraps over the whole context / reshuffles each pass (the pre-repeat behaviour).
