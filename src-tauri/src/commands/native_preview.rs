//! iOS-only commands driving the native preview playback engine (#54).
//!
//! The frontend resolves every track's proxy URL up front (via `fetch_preview_stream`) and hands the
//! whole release here; the engine plays through `AVPlayer` and owns the lock screen via
//! `MPRemoteCommandCenter` / `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`, so prev/next/scrubber keep working while the
//! WebView's JavaScript is suspended on lock. State is pushed back via `native-preview-*` events.
