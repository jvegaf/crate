//! Provisioning of the SQLCipher database encryption key.
//!
//! The key is supplied by a platform-specific [`KeyProvider`], chosen at compile
//! time by [`provision_key`]:
//!
//! - **Desktop** (`feature = "desktop"`): a plaintext `db.key` file with `0o600`
//!   permissions in the app data dir ([`file::FileKeyProvider`]) — unchanged from
//!   before this module existed.
//! - **iOS** (`target_os = "ios"`): the Keychain ([`ios::IosKeychainProvider`]),
//!   stored after-first-unlock and this-device-only.
//! - **Android** (`target_os = "android"`): the Keystore
//!   ([`android::AndroidKeystoreProvider`]).
//!
//! On mobile the key never touches the filesystem as plaintext, which is what
//! backs the "encrypted at rest" guarantee (#134).
