//! iOS key provider: the SQLCipher key lives in the Keychain as a generic
//! password, stored with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`.
//!
//! That accessibility class means the key is readable after the first unlock
//! following a boot (so background launches and sync work), but is never synced
//! to iCloud Keychain and never restored to another device. A new device
//! re-syncs its library from the cloud, so a non-portable key is acceptable.
//!
//! Single-app Keychain access needs no entitlement and no `keychain-access-groups`.
//! The service/account are fixed constants — the dev/staging/prod builds have
//! distinct bundle ids, so the OS already isolates their Keychains.
