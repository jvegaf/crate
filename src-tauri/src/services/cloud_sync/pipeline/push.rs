//! The production push pipeline.
//!
//! Mirrors the test blueprint (`tests/mod.rs::push`) but with the real lock
//! discipline (the DB `MutexGuard` is never held across an `.await`), CAS retry with
//! backoff, GC enqueue of superseded blobs, and (via the Firebase `BlobStore`) gzip.
//!
//! Flow: stamp any unstamped rows once → CAS loop: read remote manifest → pull-then-
//! merge any remote-ahead buckets via [`pull::pull_and_merge`] (so our write carries
//! the union) → recompute the local manifest → upload changed buckets →
//! `manifest.write` with the prior object keys enqueued for GC → clear the dirty queue
//! on success. The standalone pull, self-echo skip, and live updates live in the
//! sibling [`pull`] module; this push is idempotent and safe to call repeatedly.
