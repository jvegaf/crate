//! The garbage-collection sweep.
//!
//! When a push replaces a bucket blob, the prior (now-superseded) object key is
//! enqueued into the manifest's GC queue with `delete_after = now + GC_GRACE` (see
//! `push`). This sweep reclaims those blobs once the grace window has passed: dequeue
//! the due entries, delete each blob, ack the queue entry.
//!
//! It runs once per session at startup and is best-effort — a delete of an
//! already-gone blob is logged but still acked, so a failed delete never strands a
//! queue entry.
