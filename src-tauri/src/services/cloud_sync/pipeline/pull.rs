//! The production pull pipeline.
//!
//! Brings *other* devices' changes down: read the remote manifest, skip our own
//! echoes, diff it against the local manifest, download the buckets that differ, and
//! feed each through the [`merge_bucket`] engine (HLC + tombstones + add-wins). The DB
//! `MutexGuard` is never held across an `.await` — downloads happen without the guard,
//! and each merge re-takes it.
//!
//! The orchestrator ([`crate::services::cloud_sync::runtime`]) drives [`pull`] on a
//! poll (Phase 3 uses runtime polling rather than a live listener — see
//! `backend/firebase/listener.rs`). A cheap **etag gate** short-circuits idle polls so
//! we only recompute the local manifest when the remote was actually rewritten.
//!
//! [`pull_and_merge`] is the shared download+merge core, reused by the push pipeline's
//! pull-then-merge step so there is one implementation of "download the right blobs and
//! merge them" (`push::push`).
