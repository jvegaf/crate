//! The `CloudBackend` trait surface: auth + manifest + blobs + device registry.

//! Phase 1 ships exactly one implementation — [`mock::MockCloudBackend`] — which
//! powers the convergence integration test. Phase 2 adds a `firebase` sibling that
//! implements the same traits; nothing above this boundary names a vendor type.
