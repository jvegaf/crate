//! Follow artists & labels (issue #126).
//!
//! A `FollowedSource` is an artist or label page Crate watches for new releases. The
//! synced row lives in `followed_sources`; per-device watch state lives in the local
//! `followed_source_state` (last-checked, health, baseline flag) and
//! `followed_source_releases` (every URL seen under the source + its disposition).
//!
//! `crud` holds the synchronous DB methods; `watch` holds the per-source check logic
//! (the forward-looking baseline + incremental surfacing) reused by both the manual
//! "Check now" commands and the background timer; `diff` holds pure, tested helpers.
