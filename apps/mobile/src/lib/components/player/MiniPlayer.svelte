	<!-- The outer frame is anchored at the over-the-tab-bar position; the drop to the over-detail position
	     is a translateY on the INNER card (the two differ by exactly the tab bar's 3.5rem) so the reposition
	     is a pure compositor move — animating `bottom` re-lays-out every frame, concurrently with the detail
	     drawer's own slide. `fly` owns the outer element's transform for enter/exit only, so they compose.
	     The frame is `pointer-events-none` (the card re-enables them) because a transform moves only what's
	     PAINTED: the frame's own box stays at the over-the-tab-bar position, so while a detail screen is open
	     it would leave an invisible full-width band 3.5rem above the visible card that silently swallows every
	     tap under it (at z-40, above the detail's z-35) — taps landed on nothing, with no pressed state. -->
